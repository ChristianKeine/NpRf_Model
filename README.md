# NpRf_model

- calculates synaptic parameters by fitting synaptic currents from train stimulation to NpRf model. Estimates N (RRP size), p (initial release probability), R (replenishment), and f (synaptic facilitation).

- Input arguments: EPSC/IPSC amplitudes from train stimulation
- Output arguments: Struct containing estimated values for N, p, R, and f

- To use run NpRfModel with PSC amplitudes as input arguments.

- requires Optimization Toolbox and Curve Fitting Toolbox in Matlab.
